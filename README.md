Predicting beautiful sunsets

## Web App

A simple Streamlit application allows exploring the sunset score for various locations. Pick a city from the dropdown or click on the map to choose custom coordinates and press "Get Sunset Score".

### Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app can also be deployed for free on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) by connecting this repository.
